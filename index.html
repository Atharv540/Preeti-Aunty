        <p>Preeti Jain is a passionate Emotional Intelligence <b>Life and Wellness coach</b>, with rich experience in alternative healing processes. She is an <b>NLP graduate</b> (NFNLP) and an expert in the art of <b>accelerated learning skills</b>. Preeti is also a Reiki practitioner of 26 years and has been practising Pranic Healing for more than eight years.</p>

            <p>Preeti uses the gift of her humour and wit to train and achieve compelling results by using the <b>power of subconscious mind</b>.</p>
            
            <p>Ms. Jain believes that one must be nurtured with happiness from early years to help them grow positively. Hence, she works passionately with millennials and teenagers. She has been working closely with the ‘<b><a href="https://mykmm.org" target="_blank">Keep Moving Movement</a></b>’ (KMM) for many years now. During this process she has empowered more than 1500 high school students with life skills. However, her faith that happiness is not age bound also gives her freedom with all age groups.</p>
            
            <p>Preeti is a compassionate individual with high spiritual values and loves adventures. As serendipity, her interests introduced her to <b>laughter therapy</b>. She has initiated laughter clubs in different cities, for senior citizens of the society, students within school settings, in corporations and private closed groups. Her heart beats for the specially-abled community and she engages with them using laughter and other therapeutic techniques.</p>
            
            <p>She works with senior executives and HR teams to coach them towards making high-impact decisions and building strategies that ensure a highly-motivated workforce.</p>
            
            <p>Spreading smiles isn’t as easy as it sounds. In fact, the most difficult thing in the world is making someone laugh. Hence, she uses her skills, mindfulness and psychotherapy to help executives to cope with stressful situations.</p>
